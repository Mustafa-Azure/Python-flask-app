To create an architecture diagram for a Python Flask web application that manages files on an Azure Storage account, consider the following components:

Flask Web Application: The core application that handles user requests and serves the frontend.
Azure App Service: Hosts the Flask application, providing a scalable environment.
Azure Blob Storage: Stores the files uploaded by users, allowing for efficient file management.
User Interface: A web interface for users to upload, download, and manage files.


This architecture allows for a robust and scalable solution for file management in the cloud. ### Architecture Diagram Components

User Interface (UI):

A web-based interface where users can interact with the application to upload, download, and manage files.
Flask Web Application:

The backend application built using Flask, which processes user requests and communicates with Azure services.
Azure App Service:

A fully managed platform for hosting the Flask application, providing scalability and easy deployment.
Azure Blob Storage:

A storage solution for saving files uploaded by users. It allows for efficient storage and retrieval of large amounts of unstructured data.



Data Flow
User Interaction:

Users access the UI to upload files.
File Upload:

The Flask application receives the file upload request and stores the file in Azure Blob Storage.
Metadata Storage:

If using Azure SQL Database, the application saves relevant metadata about the uploaded files.
File Management:

Users can retrieve, delete, or manage files through the UI, which communicates with the Flask application.
